    -Home page with intro and form fields
    -Page when date and time is before timer
    -Page after timer with the reveal of the list

    - Connect forms with python\
        - This will create a list that will later use a function to create and instatiate a class

        - Store this somewhere
    - A way to handle number of people that is odd
